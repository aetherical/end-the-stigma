> People assume you aren’t sick 
> unless they see the sickness on your skin

> My heart is a prison of Have you tried?s 
> Have you tried exercising? Have you tried eating better? 
> Have you tried not being sad, not being sick? 
> Have you tried being more like me? 
> Have you tried shutting up? 
> 
> Yes, I have tried. Yes, I am still trying, 
> and yes, I am still sick.
