note:
    There aren't a lot of studies of the topic and how it affects IT
    professionals. Aside from the two examples which are cited in this
    talk, I've found two others. One is from the 1950's and the other
    from the 1970's. This one, from Japan is from 1990. Japan has
    historically reported a low incidence of mental illness -- 4-5% of
    the population. However, it is believed that the incidence is
    underreported and that the incidence is more along the likes of
    18-20%.
