##  Don’t Harbor Self-Stigma

> “I fight stigma by not having stigma for myself—not hiding from this
> world in shame, but being a productive member of society. I
> volunteer at church, have friends, and I’m a peer mentor and a mom.
> I take my treatment seriously. I'm purpose driven and want to show
> others they can live a meaningful life even while battling [mental
> illness].” – Jamie Brown
