##  Show Compassion For Those With Mental Illness

> “I offer free hugs to people living outdoors, and sit right there
> and talk with them about their lives. I do this in public, and model
> compassion for others. Since so many of our homeless population are
> also struggling with mental illness, the simple act of showing
> affection can make their day but also remind passersby of something
> so easily forgotten: the humanity of those who are suffering.” –
> Rachel Wagner
