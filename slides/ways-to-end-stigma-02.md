##  Educate Yourself And Others

> “I take every opportunity to educate people and share my personal
> story and struggles with mental illness. It doesn't matter where I
> am, if I over-hear a conversation or a rude remark being made about
> mental illness, or anything regarding a similar subject, I always
> try to use that as a learning opportunity and gently intervene and
> kindly express how this makes me feel, and how we need to stop this
> because it only adds to the stigma.” – Sara Bean
