> “If I watch a program on TV that has any negative comments, story
> lines or characters with a mental illness, I write to the
> broadcasting company and to the program itself. If Facebook has any
> stories where people make ignorant comments about mental health,
> then I write back and fill them in on my son’s journey with
> schizoaffective disorder.” – Kathy Smith
