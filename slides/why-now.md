note:
    There's been a lot of talk about allies and advocates for a lot of
    groups in the past few years. I've seen sessions at different
    conferences and attended some. However, Mental Health issues
    aren't talked about and a great deal of stigma is associated with
    the mental illness. So I strongly believe it's time and past that
    we start this conversation and work to end the stigma.
