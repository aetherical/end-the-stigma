<h2>Things NOT to Say</h2>
<div tagcloud shuffle >
  Get over it.
  You are not the only one.
  Don't use this as an excuse.
  You aren't trying.
  You can't be like this forever.
  Get out more.
  You are lazy.
  You are so sick.
  No one ever said that life was fair.
  Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
  So you're depressed. Aren't you always?
  Try not to be so depressed.
  Believe me, I know how you feel. I was depressed once for several days.
