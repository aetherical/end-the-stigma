note:
    This talk grew out of curiosity -- given the widespread idea that
    creative people have more incidence of Mental Health Issues, and
    the fact that there are a lot of creatives in IT, I wondered if
    there were any studies which would indicate one way or the other.
    There haven't been a lot of studies, but the few I was able to
    find have interesting conclusions.
