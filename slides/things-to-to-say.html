  You're not alone in this.
  You are important to me.
  You are not going crazy.
  When all this is over, I'll still be here and so will you.
  You can survive this.
  I canâ€™t really understand what you are feeling, but I can offer my compassion.
  You won't drive me away.
  I care about you.
  My ears are open if you'd like to tell me more about that.
  Would you like a coffee?
  Take care.
