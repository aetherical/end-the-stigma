First, in this article we discuss 10 significant occupational
stressors for computer software engineers, based on the review of the
scientific literature on their stress and mental health. The stressors
include 1) quantitative work overload, 2) time pressure, 3)
qualitative work load, 4) speed and diffusion of technological
innovation, and technological divergence, 5) low discretional power,
6) underdeveloped career pattern, 7) low earnings/reward from jobs, 8)
difficulties in managing a project team for software development and
establishing support system, 9) difficulties in customer relations,
and 10) personality characteristics. In addition, we delineate their
working and organizational conditions that cause such occupational
stressors in order to find strategies to reduce those stressors in
their workplaces. Finally, we suggest three stressor and stress
reduction strategies for software engineers. --  [Stressor and Stress Reduction Strategies for Computer Software Engineers](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11161147_Stressor_and_Stress_Reduction_Strategies_for_Computer_Software_Engineers)
